            Professional music photography, from someone who loves music as much as you do!
        </h3>
        <p>
            Having studied photography and media, when my other half needed someone to take photos of her band, it seemed natural to step in and help. Over the years, 
            I have become the official Lead Shot Hazard photographer, videographer, and music video creator, and I often support the other bands at their concerts with photography.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a band, besides the music, your image is the most important factor in developing your brand, and good images can help keep fans connected, whilst also being 
            usable by the media. I will work with you to create beautiful images and videos that showcase your music and your personality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I cover live concerts and gigs, as well as publicity shoots, group photos, and album imagery, and my turnaround time is fast, allowing you to get your images and 
            videos when you need them.
