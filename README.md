## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
This project was created as a portolfio and business site for Conor Nye, a budding photographer / videographer. He wanted a site to be able to show to prospective clients 
that showcases his skills.

## Design
### Color Scheme
* The main colors used are black (#000), white (#fff), and a shade of light blue (#a2daff). This is because blue is Conor's favourite color, and the contrast is good for 
accessibility. Black overlays are also used in 0.3 - 0.6 opacity to allow text to be visible on all photos, depending on the colors within the photo.

### Typography
* WHAT FONT AND WHY

### Imagery
* All images used are photos taken by Conor Nye, to showcase his photography skills.

### Wireframes
[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features
* Photos

### Audio
* The only audio used in this site is on the videos. The audio on these videos was recorded by Conor Nye, but the band who performed in the video owns all rights to the audio. 
Permission has been granted to allow this audio to be featured on this site.
